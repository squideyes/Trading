Although **SquidEyes.Trading** is perfectly suitable for author's own needs, thoughtful improvements are always be welcome.  Just note that a few simple rules will need to be followed when submitting a pull-request:

* A copy of the standard license header (see "Trading.sln.headertext") must be included in each new or updated source code file you submit
  * Header-text can be updated by hand or by using the author's <a href="https://github.com/squideyes/SetCodeHeaders" target="_blank">SetCodeHeaders</a> Visual Studio extension
* Changes to any one of the files in the "Docs" solution-folder will not be accepted
* Pull-requests must include full-coverage unit-tests for new or updated functionality.
